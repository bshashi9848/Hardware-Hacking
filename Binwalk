Binwalk
Firmware analysis and extraction tool

Forensics
Description
Binwalk is a tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images. It can identify embedded files, executable code, and file systems within binary files.

Installation / Check
Check if installed:

which binwalk
Install command:

sudo apt install binwalk
Basic Syntax
binwalk [options] <firmware>
Common Commands
Command	What it does	When to use	Risk
binwalk firmware.bin

Scan for signatures	Identify embedded files/systems	
binwalk -e firmware.bin

Extract files	Extract embedded content	
binwalk -Me firmware.bin

Recursive extraction	Deep extraction of nested files	
binwalk -E firmware.bin

Entropy analysis	Detect encryption/compression	
Step-by-Step Guide
1
Obtain firmware image
2
Scan with binwalk for overview
3
Extract with -e flag
4
Explore extracted file system
5
Look for configs, keys, hardcoded creds
6
Analyze binaries further
Understanding the Output
Shows file offset, description, and size of embedded content. Extraction creates _extracted folder.

Important Warnings
•
Extraction may fail on encrypted firmware
•
Some extractions require additional tools
•
Respect intellectual property laws
⚠️ Use Kali Linux tools only on systems you own or have written permission to test. Unauthorized hacking is illegal and can result in criminal charges.
